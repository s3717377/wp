                <td>Before entering University, I had not had any experience with programming or web design. But since I have taken up a course in Information Technology in RMIT, I have had basic and core experience with programming. Web design, not so much.</td>

                <th>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</th>
                <td>To be honest, I am not good with programming, well not as good as I would want myself to be, though I admire those who can and those who easily code/program; with all that said I feel as if I would be a much better designer, due to my attraction to visual learning. Though I am not saying designing is just visually putting elements on a page and calling it a day, I feel like I would have more fun and ease manifesting my vision onto a webpage than programming. However, I would like to be both! This is due to the fact that I would like to be in control of my projects, to the extent that I can rely on myself wholly.</td>

                <th>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</th>
                <td>I was always attracted to computers but never knew much about them. I saw this course as an opportunity to learn and possibly dedicate my career towards, so I had put it as a preference for when I finished VCE. It also helps that I had heard good things about RMIT and this area of education; it is needless to say I thought this was the only choice when considering IT, for me.</td>

                <th>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</th>
                <td>I am hoping to gain knowledge over computers, programs/code; to the extent that would exceed consumer grade knowledge. I am hoping to garner the courage to be able to confidently program and see it more as a hobby than a chore. I am also hoping to possibly get a job from this course! Though that is the ultimate goal.</td>

              <tr>
                <th>Assignments allow for individual or paried work. What strengths do you have and what strengths would you like your assignment partner to have?</th>
                <td>Normally I am a lazy worker, I rush my work out and sometimes it shows. However, the strength that I bring to group work is that I am a worker, with dignity! What this means is that, I usually do not like to slack off when in groups, becuase I do not want to let my group memebers down and have them feel encumbered, when they do not need to be. I feel like this dedication I would have to a team, would be extremely honest, as I would get what I am assigned done. However, for me to work like this, I need a partner to have the trait of a leader, as if they are not able to direct me to a task and have me feel like it is my job, I would not feel inclined to do the work as urgent as expected. While these might not seem like a strength, I feel like when it comes down to group work, personalities have a greater role.</td>
